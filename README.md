## Creating a Todo-List App

This tutorial will take you step by step on how to create your own todo list application using Angular. Through the tutorial, we'll be using the **Angular CLI**, create an to-do-list application, save data in the local storage and deploy the application either to Azure Static Web Apps or GitHub Pages.

This tutorial is open source and is written by the community.
